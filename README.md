# Bitcoin_Blockchain
Demonstrates the internal working of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., in the Blockchain.

#### Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dilipkondaparthi/Bitcoin_Blockchain

### Install Node.js(ignore, if you already have it)

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You can go through [nodesourceTutorial](http://nodesource.com/blog/installing-nodejs-tutorial-windows/) / [treehouseTutorial](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) for the installation process on Windows.


### After installation

1) Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.
2) Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28

### Install SHA-256(hash function) which is not available in default in JavaScript.

1) Go to the dilCoin folder which contains main.js
2) Open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool and type "npm install --save crypto-js" and execute.
2) This will download the library and automatically puts them in the node module directory which will contain the hash functions.

### Running/Executing the Code 

1) Go to the dilCoin folder which contains main.js(Make sure you have installed Node.js and SHA-256)
2) Run the command "node main.js" on the Windows Command Prompt, Terminal, Powershell or a similar command line tool.
3) Your output should look same as the one present in the "output.png" image.
